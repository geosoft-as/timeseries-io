 * Convenient for handling time series content that are larger than physical
 * memory. In this case the client should <em>clear</em> the time series
 * instance at fixed intervals:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   <pre>
 *   class DataListener implements TimeSeriesDataListener
 *   {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void dataRead(TimeSeries timeSeries)
 *     {
 *       // Process time series data
 *       :
 *
 *       // Clear signal data to save memory
 *       timeSeries.clearSignals();
 *
 *       // Continue the process
 *       return true;
 *     }
 *   }
 *   </pre>
